# ThreatScope

<a href="https://threatscope-i0tj.onrender.com/" target="_blank">ThreatScope</a> 
lets you select your industry and operational countries to provide tailored insights into relevant cyber threats, including threat **actors**, **malware** and **risk levels**. By delivering sector-specific threat intelligence, it allows your security teams to anticipate, detect and respond to cyber risks more effectively. This targeted awareness helps reduce exposure to attacks, optimize risk management and strengthen your organization's overall cybersecurity posture.

Most common cyberattacks include phishing, ransomware, malware infections, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) and credential-based attacks. Threat actors exploit software vulnerabilities, use social engineering techniques and deploy advanced persistent threats (APTs) to breach systems. Understanding these attack types helps your organization prepare and defend against evolving cyber risks.

With the help of ThreatScope, these vulnerabilities can be continuously exposed and addressed by providing real-time visibility into exploitable weaknesses and delivering actionable intelligence for timely remediation, helping your organization strengthen its defenses and reduce risk.
